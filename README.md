# Overview
Gen AI is a project focused on generating CIFAR-10-like images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The custom GAN model consists of a Generator and a Discriminator, trained to produce realistic images and differentiate between real and generated ones.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.6 or later
NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (for faster training)
Basic knowledge of deep learning and GANs
Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gen-ai.git
cd gen-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training the GAN. It can be downloaded from here. The dataset is automatically downloaded and preprocessed by the training script.

Model Architecture
The custom GAN model consists of two main components:

#Generator: The Generator takes a random noise vector as input and generates a realistic image.
Discriminator: The Discriminator evaluates whether a given image is real (from the CIFAR-10 dataset) or generated by the Generator.
The architecture of both the Generator and Discriminator can be found in the model.py file.

Training
To train the GAN, run the train.py script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
This script will:

Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Initialize the Generator and Discriminator models.
Train the models for a specified number of epochs.
Save the trained models and generated images.
You can adjust the training parameters (e.g., number of epochs, batch size) in the config.py file.

Usage
Once the model is trained, you can generate new images using the generate.py script:

bash
Copy code
python generate.py --num_images 10
This will generate 10 new images and save them in the output directory.

# Results
The results of the GAN training and generated images can be found in the results directory. Here are some sample generated images:
